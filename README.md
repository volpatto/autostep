Sometimes we don't have analytical derivatives available when we need it, so we have to perform numerical derivatives to compute it in a given point. The problem is that the step used for such computations can introduce several errors when the step is too large or too small.

How we could solve? Well, this is what `autostep` is trying to solve! Details we be provided in a more advanced stage of this project.
